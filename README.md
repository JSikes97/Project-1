## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

This is a collection of Linux Scripts and Ansible Scripts from Unit 13 of our Cyber Security course.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the 'ansible' file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

The final setup was 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a jump box and a server running an ELK stack container.
